# Intelligent-Bus-Stop-Recognition-System

✔ The Intelligent Bus Stop Recognition System identifies Bus Stops using images acquired from cameras placed on a bus using a lightweight and simple hybrid nearest neighbor algorithm and implemented using a RaspberryPi Zero, thereby eliminating the need for sensor networks. This is our final year undergrad thesis.  

✔ A Day and a Night Classifier is implemented separately in run-time, so that the Recognition Engine can be automated 24 x 7, using a light sensor or a timer.  

✔ The Bus Stops considered are in the urban city of Chennai with the bus stops being easily scalable, and a detailed version of the dataset recorded and the implementation is given in the report which can be found here: [Intelligent-Bus-Stop-Recognition-System](https://github.com/gauthkris/Intelligent-Bus-Stop-Recognition-System/blob/master/Bus%20Stop%20Recognition%20System%20Report.pdf).  

✔ The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are also explored, in terms of both memory and space.

✔ We focused on using low-resolution images to achieve the same result while not compromising on our accuracy.

Steps for running the Intelligent Bus Stop Recognition System:

1. Install Python 2.7 depending on your Operating System, via [Continuum Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

2. Open "cmd" or "Power Shell" in Windows, or Open a Terminal in Linux.

3. In the terminal, type the required [classifier approach code](https://github.com/gauthkris/Intelligent-Bus-Stop-Recognition-System/tree/master/code) as, "python file_name.py" and press Enter.

4. Repeat the above step for each of the three approaches for day and night.
